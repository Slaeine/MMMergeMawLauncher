# MMmergeMAWLauncher

This project is a one touch solution to updating and launching the Maw Mod MMMerge for Might and Magic. On launch, it gives you the option to check the other project's repo for updates, downloads it,
pushes the update to your local desktop install, and will let you launch the game.

Written in python, but future releases will bundle it in an executable.
